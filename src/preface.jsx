          The African Journal of Transport (AJoT) is the official peer-reviewed publication of the Chartered Institute of Transport Administration of Nigeria (CIoTA). The Institute was originally established in Great Britain, United Kingdom in 1944 as a professional body dedicated to promoting education to serve the emerging requirements of transport administration, and was incorporated in Nigeria in September 1986 under the Land Perpetual Succession Act Cap 98. 
          The Chartered Institute of Transport Administration of Nigeria (CIoTA) received its legislative backing when President Muhammadu Buhari signed its establishment bill into law in June 2019. The Act itself was passed by the National Assembly and enacted on May 22nd as (Act No. 27 of 2019.
          This legislative action transformed the institute from a corporate body incorporated in 1986 into the prime professional institute for the transport sector in Nigeria. The Act charges CIoTA with advancing the study, training, and practice of transport management and administration in the country. CIoTA has the statutory mandate of training, certification, and setting standards for transport professionals in Nigeria.
          CIoTA Nigeria has grown to become the premier chartered professional transport body in Nigeria, providing training, membership, and certification of transport professionals across all modes of transportation. The Institute plays a critical role in producing transport professionals who drive the economy from the point of view of transport and logistics, with the government relying on CIoTA for guidance on transportation policy and implementation.
